                Architecture is science about design, assembling and bulid building and other constructions and architectural objects. Architecture is also taking a part in organising urban area used by human. Nowadays architects use old school methods in combine with new technologies. Architectural visualisations allow to plan a buildings, bridges, architectural objects and everything else which came to your mind.
                Architectural visualisation are trying to recreate as accurate as possible the area around and project itself even before it will start to be build. 3D visualisations are used by many architects and developers as a way of promotopn and advertisment not finished investment or even not even started one.
                Visualisation 3D is an art of creating a preview representation of an object in three dimensions. Models and 3D projects can be shown as an image or move with usage of 3D animation. As more precise are those visualisations, the more are they realistic. 3D visualisation depends mostly on creativity and proper approach on showing given frame (render). That's why all architects should keep improving their skills to improve the quality of their 3D graphics.

                Architectural visualisation - the way of presenting architectural project, product etc with using three-dimension graphics, in aim to show the idea of finished project.
                Process of creation consist of given phases :
                <ol>
                    <li><a> Modeling - creating 3D objects( most of cases using 2D drawings from programs like AutoCad or Microstation)</a></li>
                    <li><a> Creating and laying materials - Currently programs allows user to simulate effects like refraction, cautistic effects or even SSS (Sub Surfaec Scattering), and materials like human skin or fruit (grapes for example)</a></li>
                    <li><a> Set up the proper light</a></li>
                    <li><a> Rendering - process in which computer counts all the light reflections on objects that are place in main stage</a></li>
                    <li><a> New programs allow us to make very precise calculation of light reflection simulation dependent on materials we've used through calculation process called global illumination.</a></li>

                Project - set of technical drawings and documentation, showing the idea of execution of given building.
                Core element of the project is a set of architectural drawings, showing the shape and size of the building, his positioning on the building ground, division of space into the rooms inside, kind of selected materials etc. In the next phases of project, the calculation and constructional drawings are made, in aim to show the kind of construction of the building and its elements. Project consist also technical report, which shows idea of the project in a written form, and drawing of construction details.
                Interim project (Conteptual) - set of architectural drawings with not a big level of details in scale (f.e 1:100, 1:200) with the purpose to show the idea of the building to interested investors and beginning acceptance of the ida. Conceptual project include normal 2d plans etc.

            <div class="more">
                Color is one of the most important things that creates interiors (no matter on purpose) of our apartments and it influence a lot on the view and the feelings which comes with given spaces. To make result we want to obtain fully satisfying we should choose colors very carefully and seriously think the composition in the whole house, using calm colors, pallet of one spectrum or two very different from each other. Making a whole project unified it's not an obstacle to give each of the room its own character.
                But before we will grab the brush and cans of paint we should know some basic rules. Very useful tool is circle and pallet of colors, which give us the power to select which color suits us the most to given room. Below I will list some crucial in my opinion elements, which i think should have been take under a consideration while planning interior design.
                <ul>
                    <li><a>Type of light which appears in a room and its intensity/currency</a></li>
                    <li><a>Surrounded colors</a></li>
                    <li><a>Size of the room</a></li>
                    <li><a>Designated function and character of the room, which are we planning to assign</a></li>
